Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Module Assignment

This repo is submitted for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. It contains the following:
An R Script called run_analysis.R
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
A tidy dataset called tidy.txt that is the result of the run_analysis.R script.

The run_analysis.R script does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
